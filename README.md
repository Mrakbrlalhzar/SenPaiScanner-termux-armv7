A Cloudflare IP scanner with a full terminal UI, built for networks where latency is unpredictable and connections drop without warning. Just run it — no commands to memorize.

It finds the Cloudflare edge nodes that actually work from your location, ranks them by real measured latency and packet loss, and lets you export the results for use in a v2ray/xray/Trojan proxy config.

---

## How it works

Run `senpaiscanner` and you land in a menu. From there you navigate everything with arrow keys and Enter — no flags, no subcommands.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ▶  Quick Scan    scan random CF IPs │
│     Custom Scan   configure details  │
│     Test IPs      validate a list    │
│     Discover PoPs find reachable DCs │
│     About                            │
│     Quit                             │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The scanner:
- Probes Cloudflare's IP ranges via TCP, TLS handshake, or full HTTPS validation
- Rotates SNI hostnames to reduce DPI interference
- Measures latency, packet loss, and jitter across multiple tries
- Identifies the PoP (datacenter) behind each IP via `/cdn-cgi/trace`
- Runs a small download sample in HTTP mode so "0% loss" does not mean "good" by itself
- Shows everything live in a color-coded table as results come in
- Exports to CSV, JSON, or plain text

## Usage

```bash
senpaiscanner           # open the TUI
senpaiscanner --version # print version and exit
```

That's it. Everything else is inside the TUI.

### Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` or `k` / `j` | move between rows |
| `←` / `→` or `h` / `l` | move between options within a row |
| `Enter` | select / confirm / start scan |
| `Esc` | go back |
| `q` | quit (or back to menu during a scan) |

### Scan screens

#### Quick Scan
Opens a three-row setup screen before starting. Use `↑/↓` to move between rows and `←/→` to pick a preset. Press Enter to confirm a row selection or to launch the scan.

**Count** — how many IPs to probe:

| Preset | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **5,000** | A few minutes on most connections — good for a quick check |
| **20,000** | Covers the active slice of Cloudflare's edge well |
| **100,000** | Thorough sweep; expect 10–30 min depending on network |
| **Custom** | Type any number, e.g. `50000` |

**Workers** — parallel goroutines:

| Preset | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **50** | Safe for slow or lossy lines; won't overwhelm limited bandwidth |
| **100** | Default — good balance on most connections |
| **200** | Faster on stable, low-latency networks |
| **Custom** | Any integer; values above 500 rarely help and may cause OS errors |

**Timeout** — per-probe deadline:

| Preset | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **2s** | Aggressive — good for fast networks; drops slow IPs quickly |
| **3s** | Default — works well on most restricted networks |
| **5s** | Relaxed — use this if you see high loss counts or many timeouts |
| **Custom** | Any Go duration string: `4s`, `1500ms`, `8s` |

All other settings stay at defaults: HTTP validation mode, port 443, 4 tries per IP, and a small `speed.cloudflare.com` download sample for ranking real data transfer.

#### Custom Scan
A form where you configure:

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Count | 500 | IPs to probe; 0 = unlimited |
| Workers | 100 | parallel goroutines |
| Timeout | 3s | per-probe deadline |
| Tries | 4 | probes per IP (for loss/jitter) |
| Port | 443 | 443 or 80 |
| CIDR | (all CF) | e.g. `104.16.0.0/13` |
| Output | (none) | `.csv`, `.json`, or `.txt` |
| Colo filter | (all) | e.g. `FRA,AMS` |
| SNI | (auto) | override TLS hostname |
| Mode | HTTP | `http`, `tls`, or `tcp` |
| IPv4 / IPv6 | v4 on | toggle with F2 / F3 |

Navigate fields with Tab / Shift+Tab. Press Enter to start. Timeout accepts Go durations like `1500ms` or `5s`; a plain number is treated as seconds.

#### Test IPs
Reads IPs from `ips.txt` (one per line, or CSV first column) in the current directory, then runs a deeper validation: 6 tries, 10s timeout, HTTP mode, colo detection, and a larger download sample. Good for confirming scan results before putting them in a proxy config.

#### Discover PoPs
Probes 300 random IPs via HTTP to map which Cloudflare datacenters are reachable from your network. Shows a table grouped by colo with average and best latency.

### Live scan keys

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `s` | cycle sort: avg → loss → jitter → colo |
| `q` / `Esc` | abort scan and go back |
| `Enter` (after done) | view results page |

## Output formats

When an output file is set in Custom Scan, all results are written there in real time.

**CSV** (`.csv`):
```
ip,loss_pct,avg_ms,min_ms,max_ms,jitter_ms,download_kbps,speed_tested,colo,tls_ok,http_status
104.21.14.53,0.0,87.40,82.10,93.60,4.20,540.8,true,FRA,true,200
```

**JSON** (`.json`):
```json
[{"ip":"104.21.14.53","loss_pct":0,"avg_ms":87.4,"download_kbps":540.8,"speed_tested":true,"colo":"FRA","tls_ok":true}]
```

**TXT** (`.txt`):
```
104.21.14.53    loss=0.0%   avg=87.40ms   jitter=4.20ms   dl=540.8KB/s   colo=FRA
```

## Tips for restricted networks

**HTTP mode by default.** A clean TCP/TLS handshake can still fail once real data starts moving. HTTP mode confirms Cloudflare with `/cdn-cgi/trace` and takes a small download sample from `speed.cloudflare.com` through the candidate IP.

**More tries = better loss estimate.** The default of 4 gives a rough picture. If your connection is particularly flaky, try Custom Scan with tries set to 6 or 8.

**0% loss is not enough.** For Iran, a "clean" IP should pass HTTP validation and show non-zero download throughput. When speed testing is active, `0 KB/s` is treated as unhealthy even if latency and loss look good.

**Filter by colo.** If your proxy server is physically in one city, restrict to that colo so you're not routing traffic around the world: set colo filter to `FRA` for Frankfurt, `AMS` for Amsterdam, and so on.

**SNI auto-rotation.** By default, the scanner rotates through several well-known Cloudflare hostnames for the TLS SNI field. If you're seeing consistent handshake failures, try overriding SNI with a domain you control that's behind Cloudflare.

**Final proxy validation still matters.** The strongest test is replacing the address in your VLESS/VMess/Trojan config and testing through Xray/V2Ray, because DPI behavior can depend on transport, SNI, path, ALPN, and fragmentation settings.

## FAQ

**Why doesn't it just run a ping?**
Cloudflare drops ICMP on their IPs. TCP on port 80 works but does not tell you much about TLS or payload transfer. SenPai Scanner defaults to HTTP validation because it is closer to real proxy traffic than TCP or TLS alone.

**How is this different from warp-plus?**
SenPai Scanner doesn't run a proxy or manage connections. It gives you a sorted list of fast Cloudflare IPs, which you plug into your own VLESS/VMess/Trojan config. Think of it as a diagnostic tool.

**IPv6 support?**
Enable it in Custom Scan with the F3 toggle. IPv6 availability on Iranian ISPs is inconsistent but it's there if you need it.

**The scan is taking forever.**
Lower workers and raise timeout: set concurrency to 30 and timeout to 8s. The default 3s is aggressive for high-latency connections.

**Where do the IP ranges come from?**
Embedded directly from Cloudflare's official published lists (`cloudflare.com/ips-v4`, `cloudflare.com/ips-v6`). The binary ships with a snapshot; there's no auto-update mechanism by design, since the ranges rarely change.
